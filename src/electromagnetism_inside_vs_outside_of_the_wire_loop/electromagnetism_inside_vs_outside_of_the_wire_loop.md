# Electromagnetism Inside Vs Outside of the Wire Loop

# Spatial Polarity of a Current Loop's Magnetic Field

**Video demonstration:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Si2_0Zwz6E

**Description:**
In this electromagnetism experiment, we use a simple setup a D battery, a wire loop, and an array of 22 hanging cylindrical magnets to reveal something surprising about magnetic polarity.

When the loop is energized and positioned so the magnets are **inside** the loop, it behaves like a **north pole electromagnet**, attracting the south poles of the hanging magnets. But when the loop is **outside** their alignment, it switches to a **south pole electromagnet**, attracting their north poles instead.

This striking pole reversal suggests a vortex-like or spiral magnetic field pattern that depends on the loop's position relative to the magnets.  

**Topics covered:**

* Electromagnetic field direction and polarity
* Magnetic pole attraction and reversal
* Relationship between current loops and magnetic fields

From a physics standpoint, what you're demonstrating is **the spatial polarity of a current loop's magnetic field**. This isn't just a flat, one-direction effect — it's a **three-dimensional toroidal field** (donut-shaped) that also has a **helical (spiral) field line pattern** inside it.

So here's my take on your questions:

* **Is it a vortex?** — If we mean “vortex” as in a spiral flow toward/around a center, then *field lines* in your setup do spiral — but they're not fluid; they're vectors describing the magnetic field's direction. So yes, in a visualization sense, you could say you're looking at a kind of “magnetic vortex” pattern inside the loop.
* **Is it a toroid?** — Yes, the magnetic field produced by a loop of current naturally wraps around in a toroidal shape. The “doughnut” is the closed path of the field lines around the loop.
* **Is a toroid a vortex?** — Not exactly in the strict physics definition — a toroid is a shape; a vortex is a motion or rotational field. But a toroidal field can have vortex-like behavior in its line patterns.  

* **What's happening in your experiment:**

  * Inside the loop, the field is directed one way (north pole behavior toward the hanging magnets).
  * Outside the loop, the field is opposite (south pole behavior toward the hanging magnets).
  * The polarity reversal is caused by the way field lines curve back outside the loop to complete their path.
* **Why this is foundational:** This is literally the starting block for understanding electromagnetism — a single energized loop is the “unit cell” of all larger coils, solenoids, and electromagnets.

# Magnetic Polarity Reversal in a Current Loop

## Overview
This experiment demonstrates the spatial polarity of a simple current loop using a D-cell battery, a copper wire loop, and an array of cylindrical magnets suspended from a string. By observing the attraction of north and south poles in different positions relative to the loop, we visualize the three-dimensional magnetic field structure of a loop of current.

---

## Apparatus
- 1 × D-cell battery (positive terminal down, negative terminal up)
- 1 × insulated copper wire formed into a loop
- 22 × cylindrical neodymium magnets suspended from a string, free to rotate
- Supporting frame to hold the suspended magnets

---

## Procedure
1. Suspend the 22 cylindrical magnets from a horizontal string so that they hang freely and align with Earth's magnetic field.
2. Position the wire loop horizontally, centered under the hanging magnets.
3. Energize the loop by connecting it to the D-cell battery (observe polarity).
4. **Inside position:** Move the energized loop so that the hanging magnets are **inside** the loop's area. Observe attraction toward the loop's *north pole*.
5. **Outside position:** Move the energized loop downward so that the hanging magnets are **outside** the loop's area. Observe attraction toward the loop's *south pole*.

---

## Observations
- When the loop encloses the hanging magnets, the magnets' south poles are attracted toward the loop's center (loop behaves as a north pole).
- When the loop is moved outside the alignment of the hanging magnets, their north poles are attracted toward the loop's outer field (loop behaves as a south pole).
- This demonstrates the polarity reversal of a current loop depending on spatial position.

---

## Interpretation
The magnetic field of a current loop forms a **toroidal shape** around the wire. Field lines emerge from one face of the loop (north) and curve around to enter the opposite face (south). Inside the loop's central region, the field direction is uniform and perpendicular to the loop's plane.

Outside the loop, the returning field lines reverse direction, creating opposite polarity behavior. The pattern can be visualized as a **toroidal vortex** of field lines, with helical components wrapping around the path of the wire.

---

## Significance
This simple experiment illustrates the foundational concept of electromagnetism: a current produces a magnetic field, and the geometry of that current determines the field's shape and polarity. All electromagnets, solenoids, and motors are built upon this principle.

---

## Suggested Extensions
- Replace the single loop with multiple turns to increase field strength and observe stronger pole attraction.
- Reverse battery polarity and observe reversal of magnetic attraction/repulsion.
- Use iron filings or a compass array to map the field pattern around the loop.
