# Electromagnetic Toroidal Field Pole Flip Summary

# Electromagnetism and Pole Flips

## Overview
The mainstream says gravity is a fundamental force, but we know it’s really electromagnetism.  
We live inside a toroidal field, with a central attractor at the geographic North Pole (Magnetic South Pole) — a black hole or singularity.  
Currently, this field is oriented *downward*, pulling everything toward the center. This is why everything feels heavy, dense, and limited.

## The Pole Flip Hypothesis
Periodically, the toroidal field flips.  
When that happens:
- The downward pull reverses to an upward push.  
- Matter becomes lighter and easier to move.  
- Biological systems run with less stress (hearts pump more easily, blood stays clean).  
- Lifespans expand into hundreds of years.  
- Megastructures like pyramids, massive plants, giant birds and insects become possible.  

This could explain why ancient civilizations were able to create massive architecture that seems impossible today.  
They were living in an era when the field was in its “light” phase.

## Current State
Right now, we are trapped in the downward pull.  
We are inside the event horizon of the black hole, with the field pressing toward the plane.  
This is why life feels heavy and limited. But when the poles flip again, everything will change — the age of lightness will return.

## Implications
- Physics must be redefined through electromagnetism, not gravity.  
- History makes sense when viewed through cycles of field reversal.  
- The future may hold a new cycle of lightness — making possible what today seems impossible.
