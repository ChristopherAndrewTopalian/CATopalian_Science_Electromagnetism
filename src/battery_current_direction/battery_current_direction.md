# Battery Current Direction

## **1. What’s really moving in that wire?**

Inside a copper wire, you have a whole lot of *free electrons* — think of them like a big crowd of people already inside a hallway. They’re there even before the battery is connected.

When you connect a battery, it doesn’t create new electrons — it pushes on the ones that are already there, making them drift along.

* **Electrons actually move quite slowly** — only millimeters per second.
* The *signal* or electrical influence, however, moves **close to the speed of light** in the metal, because as soon as you push on the first electron, it bumps the next, and so on, like marbles in a tube.

## **2. Which way do they go?**

Here’s where conventions mess with us:

* In **reality** (electron flow), electrons move from **negative (-)** to **positive (+)** because they’re negatively charged and are attracted to the positive terminal.
* In **circuit diagrams** (conventional current), people still draw the “current” as going from **positive to negative** — a historical accident from when scientists didn’t yet know about electrons.

## **3. Your “loop” question — is it one-way or meeting in the middle?**

When you connect both battery terminals to opposite sides of a wire loop:

* **Electron flow is one-way around the loop**  
* The battery pushes electrons out of the negative terminal, they travel through the wire, and are pulled into the positive terminal.
* The whole loop feels the “push” almost instantly, so even electrons far from the battery start moving at the same time (due to the electric field traveling at near light speed in the wire).

## **4. What’s inside the battery?**

Inside, there are two materials (electrodes) and an electrolyte that allows ions (charged atoms) to move inside the battery, completing the chemical reaction that keeps pushing electrons around the outer circuit.

Think of it like:

* **Inside battery:** ions move through the liquid or paste between electrodes.
* **Outside battery:** electrons move through the wire loop you connected.

If you want to **visualize** it:
Imagine a giant circle of marbles inside a clear tube. Push one marble, and the push travels around instantly, even though each marble only moves a tiny bit. The battery is the “pusher” that never stops as long as it has chemical energy left.
